# Faster-Sapphire
A Small Patch for Fire Red (Rev 1) that adds Quality of Life Improvements for playing IronMON

Removes or shortens various dialogue lines or events to speed up the beginning of the game.

This patch is not as feature-rich as the Faster Emerald patch and is more just an option for people who want to run Sapphire with a couple of minor Quality of Life improvements.
